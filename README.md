This code seeks to analyze weather data observed in state of Hawaii and report in various slices.

The input will be an SQLite database which holds temperature, precipitation, date and station data.

The data is extracted from the SQLite database into Python where some various statistics are calculated.  The data is then displayed using Matplotlib.


The next section is designed to pull in data using Python script and hold the data in a JSON dictionary.  Then make that data available via a Flask API.
